To configure the Raspberry Pi (it should have the following things), 
please install (or reinstall) the necessary items with the following 
commands in the terminal:

~ sudo apt-get install python3

~ sudo apt-get install python3-pip

~ pip3 install pymongo

~ pip3 install dnspython


The MongoDB connection string and database should all be integrated into
the code. In case you need to alter this further, I have left comments
in the code to explain things. 

You may also need to change the various parameters based on your 
environments and testing. The values I have worked for my room, they 
most likely will need to be adjusted to work with yours.
